  <h2>Why Did I Choose to Study Coding?</h2>
  <p class="movie-description">I chose to study computer science in grade 10 because I'm really interested in technology and how it can change things. Computers are everywhere now—they help us talk to each other, play games, run businesses, and even keep us healthy. Learning computer science helps me understand how computers work, how people make software, and how technology can solve problems in our everyday lives. It also teaches me important skills like problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity, which are useful in school and in future jobs. I believe studying computer science will let me contribute new ideas and help people with technology in the future. Throughout this semester, I've been coding on platforms like CodeHS, VS Code, Khan Academy, and CMU.</p>
