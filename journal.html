    <p style="font-size:75%;">
        In English class this week, we studied a challenging poem that sparked interesting discussions among my classmates. On the soccer field, we practiced hard to improve our defense and teamwork. In business class, we started a project about starting and running businesses, which made me curious about how businesses work and succeed. In science class, we learned about ecosystems and how everything in nature is connected and balanced.

    <p style="font-size:75%;">After coming back from Montreal, where I enjoyed the lively Impact game, I got back into school life smoothly. In English class, we talked about the symbols in "To Kill a Mockingbird", which made me think more about how society works. In science, we studied ecosystems, which made me realize how everything in nature is connected. Soccer practice was tough but rewarding, teaching me about teamwork and staying disciplined.

    <p style="color:rgb(251, 0, 255);">Week 3</p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">In English class, we studied Shakespeare's sonnets, which added a poetic touch to our study of classic literature. In science, we did more experiments to learn about chemical reactions and how molecules interact. In business class, we used simulations to practice managing finances and analyzing markets, which helped us improve our problem-solving skills. As the week ended, we geared up for an upcoming soccer tournament, getting ready for a weekend of exciting games and celebrating our successes together.

    <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 60);">Week 4</p>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">This week was pretty busy but fun. In Business class, we talked about networking, which got me thinking about my connections. English was all about persuasive essays, and I chose to write about why soccer is the best sport. Science is currently focused on chemistry, which isnâ€™t my favorite, but the experiments keep it interesting. Soccer practice was intense as we prepared for our game against the Tigers this weekend. Outside of school, I spent time at the park with friends discussing summer plans and hit the gym with Majd to try to get in shape . With summer break almost here, everything is getting more exciting
