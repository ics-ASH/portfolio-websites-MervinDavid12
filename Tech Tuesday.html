    <h2>Macbook:</h2>
    <h3>Key points</h3>
    <p class="small-text">The Macbook is one of the biggest names when it comes to computers, being the only eligible competitor against the PC for decades. It is a staple in technological evolution as a whole. Every few years Apple, the creator of the Macbook, has released a new and improved version of the revolutionary computer to keep customers coming back to the Macbook as their computer of choice.</p>

    <h3>The history</h3>
    <p class="small-text">Most major online stores from BestBuy to Amazon sell Macbooks at different prices depending on its condition, specs, and age. Introduced in 2006, Macbooks rely on Apple’s macOS to bring customers the unique Apple experience through a desktop. Even though you can only find Macbook Pro and MacBook Air in Apple stores, two separate versions of the base model have existed since 2006, but have been discontinued.</p>

    <h3>First generation Macbooks</h3>
    <p class="small-text">The first generation of the Macbook Pro was released on January 10th, 2006, and cost $1,999. It had a Webcam, Apple Remote, Front Row, iWeb software, and more. Unfortunately, it was discontinued in February 2012.

    It wasn’t until 2008 that the slim aluminum body design that we all know today was incorporated into the Macbook along with its iconic black keyboard. It was branded as the thinnest laptop of its time, making it not only a technological force but also an aesthetically pleasing computer. Apple called it the Macbook Air. These design features made their way into future Macbooks and Macbook Pros. Even now, with the most recent fourth generation Macbook, the same design features can be easily found.</p>

    <h2>What is a motherboard:</h2>
    <p class="small-text">The motherboard is the largest circuit board found in any computer. It is the central component that distributes electrical power to all the other parts of the computer such as the RAM, CPU, and GPU. They hold all the inputs for hardware inside and outside of the case such as the keyboard and mouse. Motherboards are made in all different styles and sizes that vary depending on the chassis and other components that anyone would want in their system. The other components of a computer must be compatible with the motherboard in order for them to function properly. For example, motherboards of a certain brand and generation will not be as versatile as a hard drive. They are typically the first part of a computer you buy when building a computer from scratch.</p>

    <h3>The history</h3>
    <p class="small-text">The oldest motherboard for personal computers included fewer real components. The Central Processing Unit and card ports were included on the first-ever IBM PC motherboard. Users put various components like memory and controller for floppy drives into the provided slots. Compaq became the first company to use a motherboard that was based on what IBM designed. They were very successful with that which led other companies to follow, even though it was a risky move. Eventually, Intel had a dominant share of the personal motherboard market. Asus, Gigabyte Technology, and Micro Star International became the three most influential companies in this industry.</p>

    <h2>AI:</h2>
    <h3>What is artificial intelligence?</h3>
    <p class="small-text">Artificial intelligence or AI is computers created to simulate human behavior that, when paired with other technologies, can perform and complete tasks. The goal of artificial intelligence is to replace humans in jobs that would typically require human intervention. The key difference between a robot and AI is that robots are built on a series of instructions that the robot will perform exactly how it is programmed to. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, can learn and change how it approaches challenges based on past experiences. This is the key factor which makes it a very human-like technology. Artificial intelligence today is at a whole different level than what was possible in the past decade. It can now process and generate everything including images, videos, sounds, actions, and words.</p>

    <h3>Weak AI vs Strong AI</h3>
    <p class="small-text">Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, is AI trained to perform specific tasks. It is related to most of the AI that surrounds us today. Strong AI is made of artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, and artificial superintelligence which is ASI. AGI is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have intelligence equal to humans. It would be self-aware with consciousness and have the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future. While Strong AI is still in the making, that doesn't mean AI researchers aren’t also exploring its development.</p>

    <h2>Blockchains</h2>
    <h3>What is a blockchain?</h3>
    <p class="small-text">Blockchains are databases that allow for information to be transferred via network. Blockchains are useful because of their chain-like structure which allows them to be chronologically consistent every time information is transferred. The data cannot be modified without direct permission from the network making it a safe way to authorize payments, share private information and more along the same line.</p>

    <h3>Why are blockchains important?</h3>
    <p class="small-text">Traditional databases have some problems when it comes to keeping track of financial transactions. For example, when selling a house, once the money changes hands, the buyer becomes the new owner. Both the buyer and the seller can write down what happened, but we can’t really trust either of them. To avoid possible legal trouble, we need someone trusted to watch over and approve transactions. But having this central authority makes things complicated and makes the system vulnerable. If someone hacks into the central database, both the buyer and the seller can be in trouble.</p>

    <h3>Common uses of blockchain technology</h3>
    <p class="small-text">Blockchains are seen all over the world in all different types of industries. For example, it can be seen in retail for trades and transactions between suppliers and buyers. The movement of products must be safe and secure to ensure that companies don’t lose money to people looking to steal their information/products. Another common example is in the entertainment industry where copyrighted information must be transferred over networks to sites and companies.</p>
