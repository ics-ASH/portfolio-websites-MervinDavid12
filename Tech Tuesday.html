<h2>Macbook:</h2>
</p><h3>Key points</h3>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">The Macbook is one of the biggest names when it comes to computers, being the only eligible competitor against the PC for decades. It is a staple in technological evolution as a whole. Every few years Apple, the creator of the Macbook, has released a new and improved version of the revolutionary computer to keep customers coming back to the Macbook as their computer of choice. 
    </p><h3>The history</h3>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">Most major online stores starting from BestBuy to Amazon sell macbooks but they sell them at different prices depending on its condition, specs and age. It is a brand name that is surrounded by three different Apple Macintosh notebook-style laptop computers. Introduced in 2006, macbooks rely on Apple’s macOS to bring customers the unique apple experience through a desktop. Even though you can only find Macbook Pro and the MacBook Air in apple store’s Two separate version of the base model have existed since 2006, but have been discontinued 
    </p><h3>First generation mackbooks</h3>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">The first generation of the Macbook Pro was released on January 10th, 2006 and costed 1,999$.It had a Webcam, Apple Remote, Front Row and iWeb software and more. Unfortunately it was discontinued in February 2012.

        It wasn’t until 2008, that the slim aluminum body design that we all know today, was incorporated into the Macbook along with its iconic black keyboard. It was branded as the thinnest laptop of its time making it not only a technological force but also an aesthetically pleasing computer.  Apple called it the Macbook Air. These design features made their way into future Macbook and Macbook Pros. Even now, with the most recent fourth generation Macbook, the same design features can be easily found.

    </p><h3>What is a motherboard</h3>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">The motherboard is the largest circuit board that can be found in any computer. It is the central component that distributes electrical power to all the other parts of the computer such as the RAM, CPU and GPU. They hold all the inputs for hardware inside and outside of the case such as the keyboard and mouse. Motherboards are made in all different styles and sizes that vary depending on the chassis and other components that anyone would want in their system. The other components of a computer must be compatible with the motherboard in order for them to function properly. For example, motherboards of a certain brand and also generations (the latest to oldest version)  will not be as versatile as a hard drive. They are typically the first part of a computer you buy when building a computer from scratch.
    </p><h3>The history</h3>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">The oldest motherboard for personal computers included fewer real components . The Central Processing Unit and card ports were included on the first ever IBM Pc motherboard. Users put various components like memory and controller for floppy drives into the provided slots.Compaq became the first company to use a mother that was used based on what IBM designed . They were very successful with that which led other companies to follow even though it was a risky move. Eventually , Intel had a dominant share of the personal motherboard. Asus, Gigabyte Technology  and Micro Star International became the three most influential companies in this industry. </p>

        <h2>AI:</h2>
    </p><h3>What is artifical intelligence?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:75%;">Artificial intelligence or AI is computers created to simulate human behavior that when paired with other technologies can perform and complete tasks. The goal of artificial intelligence is to replace humans in jobs that would typically require human intervention. The key difference between a robot and AI is that robots are built on a series of instructions that the robot will perform exactly how it is programmed to. Artificial intelligence on the other hand can learn and change how it approaches challenges based on past experiences. This is the key factor which makes it a very human-like technology. Artificial intelligence today is at a whole different level than what was possible in the past decade. It can now process and generate everything including images, videos, sounds, actions and words.
</p><h3>Weak AI vs Strong AI</h3>
<p style="font-size:75%;">Weak AI which is also known as Narrow Ai is a Ai trained to perform specific tasks. It is related to most of the Ai that surrounds us today. Strong Ai is made of artificial general intelligence also known as AGIand artificial super intelligence which is ASI. AGI is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have an intelligence equal to humans, It would be self aware with consciousness that has the ability to solve problems , learn and plan for the future . While Strong AI is still in the making , that doesn't mean AI researchers aren’t also exploring its development.</p>

<h2>Blockchains</h2>
</p><h3>What is a blockchain ?</h3>
<p style="font-size:75%;">Blockchains are databases that allow for information to be transferred via network. Blockchains are useful because of their chain-like structure which allows them to be chronologically consistent everytime information is transferred. The data cannot be modified without direct permission from the network making it a safe way to authorize payments, share private information and more along the same line. 
</p><h3>Why are blockchains important?</h3>
<p style="font-size:75%;"> Traditional databases have some problems when it comes to keeping track of financial transactions . let's say you’re selling a house. Once the money changes hands, the buyer becomes the new owner. Both the buyer and the seller can write down what happened, but we can’t really trust either of them. The seller might say they haven;t gotten the  money.  To avoid possible legal trouble, we need someone trusted to watch over and approve transactions. But having this central authority makes things complicated and makes the system vulnerable. If someone hacks into the central database, both the buyer  and the seller can be in trouble 
</p><h3>Common uses of blockchain technology </h3>
<p style="font-size:75%;">Blockchains are seen all over the world in all different types of industries. For example it can be seen in retail for trades and transactions between suppliers and buyers. The movement of products must be safe and secure to ensure that companies don’t lose money to people looking to steal their information/products. Another common example is in the entertainment industry where copyrighted information must be transferred over networked to sites and companies.
